                            <p>I’m a UX/UI designer and web developer passionate about digital mediums and the experiences created through them. I love to code just as much as I love to design, but I like to think my true talents lie in the ability to transform complex ideas and information into simple, yet delightful, experiences.</p>

                        <p>I love working with web technologies to build creative solutions. I am constantly looking for ways to write drier, cleaner, faster code while improving productivity. I embrace the challenge of keeping up with the ever-changing web and am continually impressed with the beautiful and ingenious solutions created with web languages. </p>

                        <p>Good design is where form meets function but, in the wild world of the web, there are no guarantees every meeting is going to be perfectly harmonious. As a web designer, I feel my job is to create the most aesthetically pleasing interface possible without comprising function. It is an intricate balance, and I have yet to design an interface with which I am a 100% happy. But, with each passing project, I learn a little more about what works, what doesn't, where to make comprises and where to draw a hard line. </p>

                        <p>I rarely give clients exactly what they ask for because I always strive to give them something better — what they actually want. Every project I endeavor begins with user research and as ideated with UX methodologies and principles. A process which allows me to ensure the best user experience possible. Happy users = happy clients. </p>
